### Tweaks & Fixes

- Many leveled lists have been adjusted to accommodate the new weapon additions. Let me know how it goes.
- Modified the Smithing tree to be less cluttered. Overall it will be the same in the end. Fozar's added perks for Stalhrim is now level 2 for Ebony Smithing and Nordic is now level 2 for Orcish Smithing. Morrowind Smithing technique has been moved near the start so the tree just looks better. None of the other requirements have been changed. Glass and Orcish will still require Morrowind Smithing and the descriptions have been changed to reflect this.
- A few inconsistencies with VIGILANT and 3DNPC perks were fixed
- Fixed a black face bug with Gormlaith during reading the Elder Scroll.
- Overhauled the readme. Included a noteworthy mods section, added new MCM options.
- Lucien and INIGO have been added to the NFF Ignore List by default.
