# The video game has been modified

Nearly every aspect of Tranquility is modified in some way. If something seems different from Vanilla, it's because its made to be that way.
Here you will find a list of major changes and additions to the game. This list is non-exhaustive, there may be stuff I missed out or left out because I didn't feel it was important enough.

## Legacy of the Dragonborn

- [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802) adds a new museum to the city of Solitude. Tranquility was built around Legacy of the Dragonborn and fully expects you to be engaging with it. This mod lets you display your accomplishments throughout your gameplay by showing off weapons, armors, dragon masks, daedric artifacts and more that you've obtained throughout your travels. It also contains a fully featured house equipped with a Craftloot system that lets you store and retrieve ingredients from containers for crafting

## Modified and Expanded Quests

- [Andrealpus' Harder Quests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27939?) makes a few of the vanilla quests and requirements harder by increasing the requirement or changing the conditions. The quests that are affected in Tranquility is the Temple of Mara Questline and the Bloodkin Questline
