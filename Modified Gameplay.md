# The video game has been modified

Nearly every aspect of Tranquility is modified in some way. If something seems different from Vanilla, it's because its made to be that way.
Here you will find a list of major changes and additions to the game. This list is non-exhaustive, there may be stuff I missed out or left out because I didn't feel it was important enough.

## Modified and Expanded Quests

- [Andrealpus' Harder Quests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27939?) makes a few of the vanilla quests and requirements harder by increasing the requirement or changing the conditions. The quests that are affected in Tranquility is the Temple of Mara Questline and the Bloodkin Questline
- [The Choice is Yours](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3850?) prevents certain quests from starting just from hearing rumors or passing comments. You will no longer get a quest to investigate Aventus's house when hearing guards talk about it for example. Please read the Article tab in this mod page for more information
- [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) adds a large number of localised quests through Missive Boards you can find in cities.
- [Radiant Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45427?) modifies the level requirements of receiving specific radiant quests. You will no longer be asked to clear out a vampire den or clear out a giant's camp at level 1. These will instead be offered later on as you level up
- [Enhanced Skyrim Factions - The Companions Guild](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22650) overhauls the companions questline by adding a level and skill requirement for progressing through the ranks. It also adds new unvoiced dialogues as well as AI behaviour changes such as questgivers waiting for you outside of Jorrvaskr for your return
- [Thieves Guild Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33256) overhaulsl the Thieves Guild questline by adding skill requirements as well as job number requirements to prevent you from completing the questline too early. This combined with [Thieves Night on the Town](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42069), a mod that lets you pick which hold you would like to do radiant quests with will prevent the thieves guild from being a monotonous grind
- [Save The Icerunner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34681) adds a few alternative paths to the Lights out quest. Allowing you to do more activities such as reporting Jaree-ra
