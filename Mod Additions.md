# Modifications to Serenity

## This isn't supported by me and I am not responsible for you breaking your list

If you plan to make modifications to Serenity be it adding or removing mods, you will want to get familiar with the tool SSEEdit.

SSEEdit is included in the installation of Serenity and can be accessed via the dropdown menu in Mod Organizer.

If you quickly want to make sure a mod is compatible with Serenity, install it and activate it. On the right pane, move it above RealisticWaterTwo.esp. Then open up SSEEdit Show Conflicts and wait until everything loads up. Once everything loads up you will be seeing a lot of red things on the left side.

Scroll down to the mod you added and expand the categories. Landscape/Worldspace edits can usually be ignored unless you're adding a mod that is meant to make sweeping changes to landscapes/worldspace.

If you see conflicts with leveled lists and containers, what you want to do is make an override and then forward records by clicking and dragging specific records over to the new override. This will make sure all the mods play nicely with each other.
